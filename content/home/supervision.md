If you're interested in my research work and would like to work on infant and child development, The University of Essex offers several options:

1. [The Research Experience Scheme] (RES) (https://www.essex.ac.uk/departments/psychology/research-experience-scheme) is aimed to students who have an interest in gaining research experience. The scheme gives you the opportunity to work with us on an ongoing research project for one term.
2. [Frontrunners] (https://www1.essex.ac.uk/frontrunners/) is the University of Essex paid placement scheme that gives students the opportunity to gain work experience
3. The [Undergraduate Research Opportunities Programme] (https://www1.essex.ac.uk/urop/) (UROP)  is a placement scheme specifically aimed at undergraduate students who would like to gain first-hand research experience.
