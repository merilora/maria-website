If you're interested in my research work and would like to work on infant and child development, The University of Essex offers several options:

1. [The Research Experience Scheme (RES)] (https://www.essex.ac.uk/departments/psychology/research-experience-scheme) is aimed to students who have an interest in gaining research experience. The scheme gives you the opportunity to work with us on an ongoing research project for one term.
2. [Frontrunners] (https://www1.essex.ac.uk/frontrunners/) is the University of Essex paid placement scheme that gives students the opportunity to gain work experience
3. The [Undergraduate Research Opportunities Programme] (https://www1.essex.ac.uk/urop/) (UROP)  is a placement scheme specifically aimed at undergraduate students who would like to gain first-hand research experience.

I am happy to discuss projects that fall within the scope of:

- Multisensory integration and body awareness across the lifespan
- Psychological and neural mechanisms of body awareness 
- Methodological advances in fNIRS
- The development of self-recognition 
- Mechanisms underpinning self-other distinction, including tactile interactions 
- Eating behaviour in infants and young children (psychophysiology and behaviour)
 
Please get in touch if you want to discuss possible research experience and/or PhD opportunities.
