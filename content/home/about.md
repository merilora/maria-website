# Biography

I completed my undergraduate and master degrees in Developmental and Educational Psychology at University of Padua, in Italy. Then, I moved to London to start a PhD ( funded by the Marie Curie Early Stage Researcher Fellowship) at the [Centre for Brain and Cognitive Development, Birkbeck College London] (http://cbcd.bbk.ac.uk), under the supervision of [Prof Mark H. Johnson] (https://www.psychol.cam.ac.uk/people/professor-mark-johnson). Here I investigated body perception in newborns and infants.

My first post-doctoral position at Royal Holloway University of London with [Prof Manos Tsakiris] (http://manostsakiris.com) focused on the interaction between interoceptive and exteroceptive body-related signals in the development of body-awareness in infants and adults. In 2016, I moved to University College London to work with [Prof Katerina Fotopoulou] (http://www.fotopoulou.com) and further my expertise on self- and body-awareness across the lifespan, with a specific focus on affective touch.
I joined the Department of Psychology of University of Essex in Autumn 2017 as a lecturer. 

At the University of Essex, I am part of the [Essex Babylab] (https://www.essex.ac.uk/departments/psychology/facilities/centre-for-brain-science/babylab), where I research the development of bodily self-awareness, self-recognition, and interoception using a combination of psychophysiological (e.g.; EEG/NIRS) and behavioural techniques.
