I’m interested in studying what makes babies aware of what their body really needs. Unlike other species, human babies enter the world completely dependent on their caregivers to manage their needs. For example, during feeding parental behaviour can influence the development of infants’ ability to sense their hunger and satiety signals. I am interested in understanding the relationship between interoception in caregivers and infants’ ability to promptly identify and correctly interpret their internal changes in sensations.

I am Primary Investigator on a [Academy of Medical Sciences Springboard (round 5) award] (https://acmedsci.ac.uk/grants-and-schemes/grant-schemes/springboard/springboard-awardees) (2021-2023) investigating the developmental mechanisms underlying emotional eating. For this research project, I  use a combination of behavioural and electrophysiological measures to study how parental feeding practices and toddlers’ emotion regulation contribute to the extent to which toddlers are drawn towards different types of food.
